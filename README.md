# Sales-and-customer-dashboard

Project Overview
Welcome to my Tableau project! This project features two interactive dashboards designed to analyze sales performance and customer behavior. The goal is to provide insights that help sales managers and marketing teams make informed decisions.

Features::

Sales Dashboard:-
Key Metrics: The dashboard highlights important figures like total sales ($733K), total profit ($93K), and total quantity sold (12K) for the year 2023.
Monthly Trends: You can easily see how sales and profits fluctuate month by month, helping to identify which periods are the strongest and which might need more attention.
Product Comparison: It compares sales and profit across different product subcategories, giving a clear picture of what’s performing well and what’s not.
Weekly Insights: This feature allows you to dive into weekly sales and profit data, with easy indicators for weeks that exceed or fall below average performance.

Customer Dashboard:-
Customer Metrics: Here, you'll find a summary of total customers (693), average sales per customer ($1,058), and total orders (3,312).
Customer Distribution: This visual representation shows how many orders different customers place, providing insights into customer loyalty and engagement.
Top Customers: It lists the top 10 customers by profit, offering a closer look at who contributes most to the bottom line.

Conclusion:-
This project showcases how Tableau can transform raw data into insightful visualizations that drive business decisions. I hope you find it helpful in understanding sales trends and customer behavior!
